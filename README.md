# Project goals:
After three very intense months of learning full stack web development at Codaisseur, building this app has helped me overcome great early challenge:

- Build a full stack application from scratch
- Design the app wireframe, user stories and database
- Create a database & set up database relations
- Use React and Redux to create a multipage app and manage the state of the data
- Fetch the data from the database and render it in the frontend
- Dispatch actions for the user to modify information
- Work with structured git version control

# Technologies used:
- JavaScript
- React & Redux
- Node JS
- Bootstrap (Styling)

# User stories:
Feature 1. I want users to see a HomePage which contains the main features of the App.
Feature 2. As a user, I want to be able to track my habits to register whether I have complied or not with it today.
Feature 3. As a user, I want to be able to create a new habit.
Feature 4. As a user, I want to register and track my weight to see if I am losing or gaining it throughout the days.
Feature 5. As a user, I want to practice Yoga for more or less minutes depending on my mood.
Feature 6. As a user, I want to keep track of my skills goals to see if I am improving with the time or not.
