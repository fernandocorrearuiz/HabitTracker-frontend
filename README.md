üëã Welcome to Habit Tracker! A place for Personal development
What this app is about üìù
Although this app is still in progress (I still have some features in mind that I'd like to implement), this is a space for users to keep track of their goals and weight. You can create new daily habits and control your performance to achieve your goals. Also, the app helps you do Yoga sessions through a timer and sound effects.

Project goals
After three very intense months of learning full stack web development at Codaisseur, building this app has helped to unify all the knowledge acquired:

Build a full stack application from scratch
Design the app wireframe, briefing (user stories) and database diagram
Create a database & set up database relations
Use React to create a multipage app and Redux to manage the state of the data
Fetch the data from the database and render it in the frontend
Dispatch actions for the user to change the database values
Work with structured git version control
